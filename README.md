# Timeline Tracker API

## Summary

Timeline Tracker is a tool developed to assist in planning and organizing TTRPG campaigns, fictional narratives, or any other creative
writing project. This tool can help you manage the people, places, items, events, and lore of constructed worlds. The initial motivation for
this project came from my need to track and manage the plenitude of ideas that I have for a TTRPG campaign that I am running. 

See [Resource Details](Wiki/resourceDetails.md) for in-depth explanation on how information can be stored and retrieved using Timeline
Tracker API.
